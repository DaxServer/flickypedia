    This test verifies that our login code works.

    I had to be a bit careful with this, because I had to use our real
    OAuth credentials to set up this test.

    What I did:

    1.  Ran the first half of the test, up to the commented-out ``assert 0``.
        This gave me a real authorization URL I could open in Wikimedia.

    2.  I clicked that authorization URL, which took me to a localhost:5000/â€¦
        URL.  I pasted that into the callback_resp line, and matched the state
        to the session cookie.

    3.  I ran the entire test, with the ``assert 0`` commented out.  This did
        the token exchange with Wikimedia.

    4.  I redacted the secrets from the URL and the VCR cassette.
